            <h2>Ancient lake in Mars’s Gale crater may have actually been a small pond</h2>

            <p>A purported ancient lake on Mars may have been far smaller than researchers thought. NASA’s Curiosity rover has been
            exploring Gale crater for more than eight years, and while early observations suggested the entire crater may once have
            been filled with water, a new analysis implies that it just had a series of ponds instead.
            
            Previous analyses of data from Curiosity have relied heavily on a measure called the chemical index of alteration to
            determine how rocks were weathered over time. Joseph Michalski at the University of Hong Kong and his colleagues have
            suggested that because this measure was developed for use on Earth, it may not be valid in the extreme Martian climate.
            
            Instead, they analysed the concentrations of various compounds that are expected to change based on different types of
            weathering over time. They found that some of the layers of rock Curiosity examined did interact with water at some
            point in their past, but more are likely to have formed outside of the water.
